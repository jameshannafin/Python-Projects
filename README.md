# Python-Projects

These are some of my larger Python projects I made during my bootcamp.
They include various libraries and frameworks including SQL, Django, and Tkinter. I also make use of virtual environments.

1. Phonebook Project

    This project is a simple and clean phonebook that uses TKINTER for its GUI and SQL to manage a database. Users can create, delete, and update information about their contacts in this app.

2. Bank Project

    This project uses the Django frame work to create an example of a banking application. Users have the ability to create an account, sign in, and view transaction history.

3. Django University

    This project is a simple template that simulates a school API that will let the user add, update, and delete courses along with their information.

4. Assignment222

    This is a simple project that demonstrates the storage and retrieval of information out of a database using SQL commands.

5. Game

    This is a simple game that uses Python logic to tell a brief stroy on the power of kindness.

6. File Transfer

    This is a program that uses Tkinter as its main canvas. The text and buttons are layed out on a grid system. This application allows the user to select a source follder and a destination folder and then initiate a file transfer process that will check if a folder has been edited in less than 24 hours and if so moves it to a new folder 

7. New File Maker 

    This is a simple application that allows the user to create a new HTML file that will open as a webpage in there browser. It also allows the user to update that file with new body text. I use tkinter as the GUI for this.
